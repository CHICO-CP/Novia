# ðŸ’– Novia ðŸ’–

This project is an interactive page created for a romantic proposal. Upon loading, the page asks the question, **"Will you be my girlfriend?"** with two answer options: **Yes** and **No**.

## Features

- Animated romantic GIFs.
- Interactive buttons that change positions on click.
- Personalized messages based on the selected option.
- Floating hearts generated randomly on the screen.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the romantic proposal page.
- `styles.css`: Styles and animations for the page design.
- `script.js`: Logic for button interaction and floating heart animations.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CHICO-CP/Novia.git
   ```
 2. Open the index.html file in your browser to view the page.



## Interactivity

The script.js file manages the main logic for button click events and heart animation:

"Yes" Button: Displays a romantic message and changes the GIFs.

"No" Button: Switches positions with the "Yes" button and does not display a message.

Animated hearts: They are generated automatically and disappear after 5 seconds.
